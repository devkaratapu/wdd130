    <h3>Dave</h3>
    <p>My name is Dave. My major is Computer Information Technology and I want to become a Cloud Engineer. I love Art and music other than programming. 
    My wife is from Nepal and I am from India, our daughter is from here. I love to learn new things, and I love the spirit of BYU-Idaho. I think web design is really important skill one should have as we use web every single day of our life.

    <p>I have been a member of the church since 2004. I love the scripture from Moroni 7:33 "And Christ hath said: if you will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatshoever thing is expedient in me". I am excited to learn from all of you. Thank you.
